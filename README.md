ML URL Classifier (work in progress) | Classifies a set of URLs given by a JSON file using the KNN and Logistic Regression algorithms. This is a work in progress with one function experiment on a small labeled dataset (~400 observations, 1 feature, 2 classes). Pending progress involves testing the existing workflow in `main.ipynb` against a larger labeled dataset and including more labels in the classification problem.
